Trying to help with what I've got.

If you represent a government, health organization, publisher or non-profit and are on a mission to propagate helpful and verified factual information regarding COVID-19 across your existing (or exploring new) channels, I would like to offer my services, free of charge. As I write this, I realize this offer won’t scale, so I'll be looking for a little help from my opensource friends (that IS LIKELY you).
